# What is this
Salami is a coding language created by me, Salamoonder, as a way to practice my Java skills and have some fun with it too.

Salami is made to be easy to read at a glance, but offer more complex practices if you need them. You should also be able to extend a screen extension and make your own cool little "games" and stuff.

The file `thisfileshouldwork.salami` should be able to be executed without error by the end of this project. This project should also be able to be easily edited, so if maybe someone else wanted to add their own custom keywords and stuff they can easily do that.

# How to use
I have no idea how to build this into an executable or what that would even look like, but here is a way you can try it on your own:
1. Download the source code.
2. Make sure you have JDK 17 installed
3. Run `java Main <enableRepl> <fileName>`

## Repl?
Basically, it's just a terminal for SalamiCode. You can type stuff and see what my parser spits out. It doesn't interpret anything (yet) but if you would rather have a quick way to look at it then replace `<enableRepl>` with `true`.  
If you enable the repl from the command line you don't have to supply a file name either :).

## File?

Inside of the `assets/source` folder, there's a file called `test.salami` which is the default file for a lot of things. Just copy that absolute path and throw it into the command line argument and you should be good to go.  
Note: You do still have to put `false` at the start to tell the program that your not using real, and loading from a specific file.  
Note 2: You can specify any file you want on your computer. Just if you wanted to.

Visit the wikis if you're confused. There's some information there.
