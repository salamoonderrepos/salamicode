# What is this
Salami is a coding language created by me, Salamoonder, as a way to practice my Java skills and have some fun with it too.

Salami is made to be easy to read at a glance, but offer more complex practices if you need them. You should also be able to extend a screen extension and make your own cool little "games" and stuff.

The file `thisfileshouldwork.salami` should be able to be executed without error by the end of this project. This project should also be able to be easily edited, so if maybe someone else wanted to add their own custom keywords and stuff they can easily do that.
