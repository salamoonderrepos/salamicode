# What is this
SalamiCode is a coding language designed and developed by Salamoonder. SalamiCode is meant to be an easy-to-learn, assembly-like, dynamically typed language.
Simply create a file ending in `.salami`, and run it with the java program (look below).

# How to use (currently)
I have no idea how to build this into an executable or what that would even look like, but here is a way you can try it on your own:
1. Download the source code.
2. Make sure you have JDK 17 installed
3. Run `java Main <fileName> <enableRepl>`

## Repl?
A terminal for SalamiCode so you can test it without having to make a new file. Just set the `<enableRepl>` flag to `true` and it will launch the console. Each line you enter is treated like a line from a file, so the parser thinks it's actually reading from a file line by line.

## File?

Inside of the `assets/source` folder, there's a file called `test.salami` which is the default file for a lot of things. Just copy that absolute path and throw it into the command line argument and you should be good to go.  
Note: You do still have to put `false` at the start to tell the program that your not using real, and loading from a specific file.  
Note 2: You can specify any file you want on your computer. Just if you wanted to.

Visit the wikis if you're confused. There's some information there.
